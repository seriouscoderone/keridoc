ADC

Term found but the definition does not exist yet.

agency

Any executive department, military department, government corporation, government controlled corporation, or other establishment in the executive branch of the government (including the Executive Office of the President), or any independent regulatory agency, but does not include: (i) the Government Accountability Office; (ii) the Federal Election Commission; (iii) the governments of the District of Columbia and of the territories and possessions of the United States, and their various subdivisions; or (iv) government-owned contractor-operated facilities, including laboratories engaged in national defense research and production activities.

AID

A globally unique identifier of a card application as defined in ISO/IEC 7816-4.

API

A system access point or library function that has a well-defined syntax and is accessible from application programs or user code to provide well-defined functionality.

authenticity

The property of being genuine and being able to be verified and trusted; confidence in the validity of a transmission, a message, or message originator

BFT

Term found but the definition does not exist yet.

binding

Process of associating two related elements of information.

CBOR

Term found but the definition does not exist yet.

claim

A true-false statement about the limitations on the values of an unambiguously defined property called the claims property; and limitations on the uncertainty of the propertys values falling within these limitations during the claims duration of applicability under stated conditions.

collision

An event in which two different messages have the same message digest.

credential

Evidence attesting to ones right to credit or authority. In this Standard, it is the PIV Card or derived PIV credential associated with an individual that authoritatively binds an identity (and, optionally, additional attributes) to that individual.

CRUD

Term found but the definition does not exist yet.

CT

A framework for publicly logging the existence of Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates as they are issued or observed in a manner that allows anyone to audit CA activity and notice the issuance of suspect certificates as well as to audit the certificate logs themselves. (Experimental RFC 6962)

DAG

Term found but the definition does not exist yet.

DAR

Term found but the definition does not exist yet.

DID

Term found but the definition does not exist yet.

domain

A set of elements, data, resources, and functions that share a commonality in combinations of (1) roles supported, (2) rules governing their use, and (3) protection needs.

HSM

Term found but the definition does not exist yet.

IANA

Term found but the definition does not exist yet.

identity

Unique group element \\(0\\) for which \\(x+0=x\\) for each group element \\(x\\), relative to the binary group operator \\(+\\).

issuer

The organization that is issuing the PIV Card to an applicant. Typically, this is an organization for which the applicant is working.

JOSE

Term found but the definition does not exist yet.

JSON

Term found but the definition does not exist yet.

key

A parameter used in conjunction with a cryptographic algorithm that determines the specific operation of that algorithm.

MFA

Authentication using two or more factors to achieve authentication. Factors include: (i) something you know (e.g., password/personal identification number \[PIN\]); (ii) something you have (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token); or (iii) something you are (e.g., biometric).

NFT

An owned, transferable, and indivisible data record that is a digital representation of a physical or virtual linked asset. The data record is created and managed by a smart contract on a blockchain.

P2P

Term found but the definition does not exist yet.

party

An individual (person), organization, device, or a combination thereof. In this Recommendation, an entity may be a functional unit that executes certain processes.

PGP

Term found but the definition does not exist yet.

PKI

The architecture, organization, techniques, practices, and procedures that collectively support the implementation and operation of a certificate-based public key cryptographic system. Framework established to issue, maintain, and revoke public key certificates.

PRNG

A deterministic computational process that has one or more inputs called "seeds", and it outputs a sequence of values that appears to be random according to specified statistical tests. A cryptographic PRNG has the additional property that the output is unpredictable, given that the seed is not known.

revocation

The process of permanently ending the binding between a certificate and the identity asserted in the certificate from a specified time forward.

RID

Term found but the definition does not exist yet.

SAD

Term found but the definition does not exist yet.

salt

As used in this Recommendation, a byte string (which may be secret or non-secret) that is used as a MAC key by either: 1) a MAC-based auxiliary function H employed in one-step key derivation or 2) a MAC employed in the randomness-extraction step during two-step key derivation.

security

A condition that results from the establishment and maintenance of protective measures that enable an organization to perform its mission or critical functions despite risks posed by threats to its use of systems. Protective measures may involve a combination of deterrence, avoidance, prevention, detection, recovery, and correction that should form part of the organizations risk management approach.

sniffer

See packet sniffer and passive wiretapping.

SSI

Term found but the definition does not exist yet.

TCP

TCP is one of the main protocols in TCP/IP networks. Whereas the IP protocol deals only with packets, TCP enables two hosts to establish a connection and exchange streams of data. TCP guarantees the delivery of data and also guarantees that packets will be delivered in the same order in which they were sent. 

TEE

An area or enclave protected by a system processor.

TPM

Term found but the definition does not exist yet.

TSP

Term found but the definition does not exist yet.

UI

The physical or logical means by which users interact with a system, device or process.

URL

A uniform resource locator, or URL, is a short string containing an address which refers to an object in the "web." URLs are a subset of URIs.

VC

Term found but the definition does not exist yet.

VDS

Term found but the definition does not exist yet.

verifier

An entity that verifies the claimants identity by verifying the claimants possession and control of a token using an authentication protocol. To do this, the Verifier may also need to validate credentials that link the token and identity and check their status.

witness

An appropriately cleared (if applicable) and designated individual, other than the COMSEC Account Manager, who observes and testifies to the inventory or destruction of COMSEC material.
