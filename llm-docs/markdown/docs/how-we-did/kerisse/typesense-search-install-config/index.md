# Typesense search install and configuration

What is this: the necessary Typesense search engine _commands and configs_ to serve the KERISSE site best

For who: maintainers and search engine configurators that want a head start and learn from _how-we-did_ it for the KERI Suite Search Engine

Objective: because the search engine software is not our core business we chose to organise this away from us as far as possible. So we hire Typesense hosting | TBW link |

Result: A configuration that automatically indexes all native and scraped content in a way that we integrate pre-configured features with every run, like:

-   overrides
-   synonyms
-   nearby vector searches
-   ranking
-   filtering options

These are the instructions we followed and implemented in the site, from Oct 2022.
